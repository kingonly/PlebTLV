# Who can apply to the program?
Anyone who wants to build a Bitcoin or Lightning venture. 
# What's the format?
The first 4-8 weeks are dedicated to training and ideation. Selected mentors work closely with the teams to refine their ideas and develop a prototype. Based on the initial work, Pleb TLV will decide whether to continue working with the team and enter a second stage (2-3 months), during which we provide continued mentoring, funding, and access to our global network. The second stage prepares the company for an initial release (MVP) and to secure additional funds.    
# How much do you invest?
Investment terms and tools will vary for each project depending on its stage and needs.
# Do you provide office space?
Yes, we can provide teams with suitable office space in the center of Tel-Aviv.
